# SQL databases from scratch
Working with databases is an essential skill for many developers. In this workshop, we will learn the basics of working with relational databases.

Many databases are so-called *relational* databases. These consist of *tables* that can be queried alone or together. To interact (query, update, ...) with the database you need to use the programming language known as SQL. Databases can be used on their own, but are often part of a larger application. In this case, there is usually a web API attached to the database that can be used to query and update the database from a distance.
