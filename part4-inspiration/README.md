# Part 4: optional exercises and inspiration
Working with APIs and databases is a central skill in many development jobs. The following exercises will give you a good impression of what each of this jobs is like. 

Try writing tests (as in part 4) to verify your implementations are correct.

## for backend developers
+ implement authentication on your API, so that only approved users can interact with your API.
+ SQL injection is an important vulnerability [insert link]. Implement a way to prevent SQL injection on your API.
+ Research other security vulnerabilities and protect your API against them.

## for frontend and fullstack developers
+ write a frontend app to provide a graphical user interface to interact with the API.

## for data scientists
+ Use your favourite visualization library to show your insights into the dataset.
+ Research more advanced SQL methods such as ROLLUP and PIVOT to provide more detailed insight into the dataset.

## for DevOps specialists
+ Deploy your API to a machine in the cloud [insert links to platforms here].
+ Research security vulnerabilities and protect your API against them.
+ Set up a daily backup for your database. Practice deleting a table and restoring the database. Verify that the data you removed before is back.
+ Keep your code in a GitHub repository and use TravisCI to run the tests on each commit.
