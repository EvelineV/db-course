# Part 3: building a ReST API
We will use Python with Flask to build a web API, which will allow you to edit your database over the web. Test files are provided, you can run these using pytest. Use these to verify the correctness of your implementations.

The example code has a List and a Create endpoint already. Implement the Detail, Update and Delete methods.
